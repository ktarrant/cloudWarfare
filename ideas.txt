Cloud Warfare
=================

Blobs fight each other in a 2-D (3-D world) platformer.

Blobs can:

(1) Suck/blow/cannon each other. possibly gain/lose powers
(2) "Spike" one another downwards
(3) Fly in little upward bursts
(4) Turn into a hard rock (?)
(5) Kicks, punches, combos, etc.

The environment will consist of:

(1) Flat and diagonal platforms
(2) Clouds that act as temporary platforms
(3) Items to use against each other (bumper, shell)

Other ideas:

(*) Controller support
(*) Local multiplayer
(*) Varied and customizable control scheme
(*) Customizable blobs


Game Plan
=============

Get a demo with some basic physics up, see if Arjun is interested.
